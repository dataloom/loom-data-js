The `lattice.js` library is a layer on top of OpenLattice's REST APIs to simplify the process of reading data from and
writing data into the OpenLattice store. The library exposes a thin wrapper around each of OpenLattice's REST APIs to
standardize the data models and formats used, and facilitate communication with OpenLattice.
