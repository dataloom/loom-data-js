# Loom Data

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/openlattice/lattice-js.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

The `loom-data` library is a layer on top of Loom's REST APIs to simplify the process of reading data from and
writing data into the Loom data store. The library exposes a thin wrapper around each of Loom's REST APIs to
standardize the data models and formats used, and facilitate communication with Loom.
