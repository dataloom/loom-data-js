# lattice.js

[![greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/openlattice/lattice-js.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

The `lattice.js` library is a layer on top of OpenLattice's REST APIs to simplify the process of reading data from and
writing data into the OpenLattice store. The library exposes a thin wrapper around each of OpenLattice's REST APIs to
standardize the data models and formats used, and facilitate communication with OpenLattice.
